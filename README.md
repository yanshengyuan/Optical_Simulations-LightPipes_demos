# Optical_Simulations-LightPipes_demos
The simulation based on the diffraction models in the wave optics theory using LightPipes for Python 2.7

The videos for all the simulations in this repository can be found and will be constantly updated here: https://b23.tv/V9Z0zXH

To run the simulations in this repository, you need:

-Python >=2.7

-LightPipes

-matplotlib


How to run the simulation and visualization:

1, Install a real-time in-loop python/numpy data visualizer, e.g., Spyder.

2, For the simulations other than "GS Algorithm Phase Retrieval", just open the simulation scripts into Spyder (or other visualizer of yours) and F5 or click "Run" button.

3, Then you will see the real-time simulation and its in-loop visualization on the data inspector screen.

4, For the demo simulation "GS Algorithm Phase Retrieval", please open the python script in the folder and specify the path to your images or npy array fiels of the two planes then run the script.

5, The specific visual effect can be referred from the demo videos in the Bilibili video channel I shared at the beginning.


Have Fun!! And please come back to check this repository regularly and more often. And please also follow and check my video channel regularly: https://b23.tv/PHikTIF

More simulations and more demo videos will be posted here and in my video channel as I think of some more interesting simulation ideas.
